# Explanation of PlainJSModal_html & modal.js
## HTML:

The #overlay element creates a semi-transparent background that dims the rest of the page.
The .modal element is the actual modal window.
## CSS:

We use display: none to hide the overlay initially.
display: flex is used when showing the modal to center it on the screen.
## JavaScript:

Event Listeners: These handle interactions like opening/closing the modal.
Overlay Click: Clicking outside the modal (on the overlay) closes it.
